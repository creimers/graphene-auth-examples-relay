This repo contains a react relay app for my [graphene auth examples](https://github.com/creimers/graphene-auth-examples).

It was created to explore authentication and authorization in relay.

The app can

* register a new user
* confirm the user's registration
* login a user
* logout a user
* display a user's profile
